44 - NOTES ΟΝ THE

of public authority, sometimes inartificialis
enough employed, Virgil hath projedled one of
the noblest allegories in antient poetry‚ and at
the same time hath given to it all the force οἱ
just compliment, the occcfion itself allowed.
Erech of these excellencies was to be expedied
from histalents. For, as his· genius led himto -
the firblime5 so his exquisite judgment would in⁴
ssrudi him to palliate this bold herion, and qua·
lisy, as much as poffible, the lhocking adulation,
implied in it. So srngular a beauty deserves to
be lhewn at large. ,

The third Geororc sets out with an apology
for the low and limple argument of that work,
which, yet, the poet, esteemed, for its novelty»,-
preferable to the sublimet, but trite, themes of
the Greek writers. Not but he intended, on
some· future occasion, to adorn a noblcr subjedt.
This was the great plan of the Aeneis, which he
now prefigures and unfolds.at large. For, tale·-
ing advantage of the noblest privilege of his
avt, he breaks away, in a fit of prophetie enthu-
sralm, to foretel his succelles¹ in this projeeted
enterprize, and, under the imagery of thean-
tient triumph, which comprehends, or suggesto
to the imagination, whatever is most august in
hdman affairs, to delineate the future glories of¹
this ambitione defign. The whole conception,

ae we dull see, is of the utmost grandeur and
magnificence3
