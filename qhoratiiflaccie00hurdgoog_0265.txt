Ι must afford the highest pleasure to senfible
and elegant minds, is not perfedly suited

to the apprehenfions of the generality.

Are they susceptible of the soft and deli·
cate emotions which the fine distress in the
Testament is intended to raise? Every one
indeed is capable of being delighted
through the paffions3 but they must be
worked up„ as in tragedy,' to a greater

height, before the generality can receive

jedlion it will be said, holds against the
finer strokes of character. Not, I think, ,
with the same force I doubt our sense-of
imitation, especially of the ridiculous,ir

quicker'than our humanity. But 1Ι deter-
mine nothing. Both these pleasur‘es are
perfedly confistent. And my idea of com·

edy requires only that the pathos be kep't
in subordination to the manners.
