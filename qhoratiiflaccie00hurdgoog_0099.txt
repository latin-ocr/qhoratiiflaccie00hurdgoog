lng in the eules ey‘dramatic writing, give this praese
te Pacuvius. The expression is so put, as if
Quinctilian intended a censure of the& critics3
he'ca'iase this pretence to dramatic art, and the
stri& imitation of the Greek poete, was grown,
in hls²time‚' and long before it, into a degree of
podantry and affiliatim no other merit but
thie of dani, being of any significancy, in their
account. There is no reason to think that
Qinffllian meant to inlinuate the poet’s want
of this merit, or his own contemptos it: though
he might think, and with reason, that too much

stress had⁴ been laid upon it by some men.
, Itis in the same manner that one of our own

poeta has been charaeterized 3 and the appli-
cation of thie term to him will lhew the force
of it, still more clearly.

‚In Mr. Pope's line imitation of this epistle, are

these lines-

In all debates‚ where critice bear a part,
Not one but nods and talks of lohnlon's art·-

One seen then, how Mr. Pope understood
the dani, of Horace. But our Milton applica
the word learned itself‚ and in the Latin sense of
it, to J0hnson-

When John'lon's learned lock is ori-⁴

For· what ie this learning? indisputably‚ his
