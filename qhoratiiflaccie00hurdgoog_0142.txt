particular passages· The reader is not only told,
,that a passage has merit; but is informed what
sort of merit belongs to it. · , ,

Neither are the remaining observatione wholly

Α , without use.' For sucb particular beauties¹ and

blemilhes, as are barely collected, tnay yet serve as
,a foundation to suture inquiren sor making fur.

so many stngle fauts, an attention'to which is ex‘-
,cited by the authority of the critic ς and when ,
these, are consideredjointly with such as others

‚mayhave observed, those general principles of·

enable us to constitute retu 'cl lses of poetical ·

Thus sar the candid reader may go in apolo-
gizing osor the meriti of tbese writers. But as,

'dulged a't the expence of justice, I think myself
obliged to add 'an observation concerning their

principles here delivered..

reason is, they dwell too much in generals: that

species, is too large, but those very subordinate

‚species themselves are too comprehensive. ·. Ο
