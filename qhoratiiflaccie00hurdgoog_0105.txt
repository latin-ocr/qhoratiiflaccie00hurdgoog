7¹⁴This rs the true account of popular fame,
which, while rt well explains the ground of the
poet’o aphorism, suggests au obvious remark
but very mortrfyurg to every candrdate o fliterary
glory. It rs, that, whether he succeeds ιιι his
endeavours after publicnapplausu or not,same rs
equally out of his ruach, and, as the moral poet
teaches, athing beyond him, bgfore his death, on
either supposrtion. For at the very tiore, that

he carr hever be sure, if, instead of the divihe
consentient harmony of a just psalle, ιι henot
ooly ιιιε discordant din and clamour of rgnor-
auce or preposseffion.

If there be any exception to this melancholy
truh, it must be ιιι the case of some uncom
ιιιοιι genius, whose superior ¹power breaks
through ull impediments ιιι his road to farne,
and forces applause even from those very pre-
judices, thot would obstru& his career to ιι.
