But this was not all: For, Sucoumu, an old .
satiust, of high birth and quality, Lucruus,
was consrdered, not only as an able writer of
this class, but as a perse& model in ir, andos
course, therefore, this new satirist would be
¹much decried and undervalued, on the compari-

son. This circumstance obliged the poet to
reduce this adrnired writer to his real value3

which could not be done without thwarting the

general admiration, and pointing our his vicenx
· and defetrs in the freest manner. ,This perilous

x talk he discharged in the tvm satire of his first
book, and with such rigour of criticilm, that
not only the parrizans of Lucilius, in the poet’s

own age, but the most knowing and candid*
critica of succeeding times, were disposed to

complain of it. However‚ the obnoxious step

⁵ had been taken; and nothing remained burto

justify himself, as he harh done at large, in his
xth satire.

On the whole, in comparing what he has
said in these two satires with what Qrindlilian
long after observed on the subjedi of tlierr'r, ‘tlt'e're
seems no reason to conclude,¹ that the poet
judged 1113 though he exprell'ed his judgme'nts'in
